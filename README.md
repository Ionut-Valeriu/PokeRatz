# PokeRatz

### Description

Very original (I hope)

The protagonist of this game (you ofc) is living in a world of chaos where he has to pay taxes!

You hate that and think the government just steal money from you (which actually happens).
You only have access to rats, a lot of rats, because you have almost no money coz you pay taxes.
So you manage to upgrade them and somehow trap them into some magic cards (a dude in the hood gave you those).

### My goals for this project are:

- [ ] Separating the creatures in 3 categories that counters each other
- [ ] Separating the whole game in scenes:
  - [ ] Main Menu Scene
  - [x] Default Game Scene
  - [ ] Battle Scene
- [ ] Implementing evolution
- [ ] Adding more things on this list
